# D3stats

This is a small project of mine that uses Blizzards Diablo 3 API. This is a work in progress.

It is built with Django 1.8 and Django Rest Framework.

It stores information about accounts and heroes once a day for each of those. With this information you could render a chart on the frontend thats shows the player progress.

Frontend has an Angular boilerplate setup but only authentication was worked on right now.
